	<li style="font-weight:bold;"><strong>After GS105Ev2 is upgraded to FW version V1.5.0.4 or higher, it cannot work with Plus Utility version prior to V</strong><strong>2.4.3.<br />
	&nbsp;Please download the latest Plus Utility from </strong><strong><a href="http://www.netgear.com/support/product/PCU">http://www.netgear.com/support/product/PCU</a></strong></li>
	<li style="font-weight:bold;"><strong>Once GS105Ev2 FW has been upgraded to V1.5.0.4, you need to login to web GUI to upgrade boot loader.

Firmware will detect the IC version automatically and prompt you for the required boot loader version on the upgrade GUI page.</strong></li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>Download the new firmware 1.5.0.4 from NETGEAR product support Website and store it in local PC, and remember its location in the PC&rsquo;s file system. Unzip it to get the switch firmware image &ldquo;<strong>GS105Ev2_V1.5.0.4.bin</strong>&rdquo;.
